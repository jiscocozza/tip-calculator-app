# Coding Challenge: Tip calculator app

## Description
This is a small coding challenge project from Frontend Mentor. It is part of my training and learning path to becoming a web developer.

In this project, I've built a tip calculator where users are able to:

* View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person
